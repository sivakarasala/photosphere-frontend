Built on [React](https://reactjs.org/) and bundled with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).



## Pre-reqs

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed to run this code.

```

## Run the Parcel dev server

Run the dev server like this:

Then click the link or point your browser at the default location for Parcel: [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234).

## Build the static web page

Build the project to a static web page like this:

```bash
npm run build
```

The static web page is output to the `dist` subdirectory.

## Test the static web page

After building the static web page, you can test it locally using `live-server`.

First install live-server globally:

```bash
npm install -g live-server
```

Now change into the directory where the static web page is generated:

From here, start live-server:

The web page should automatically be displayed in your browser.
